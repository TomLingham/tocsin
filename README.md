# Tocsin - ad-hoc monitoring for good

**Warning: This is a very early preview.**

Tocsin is an extremely small, simple, and (mostly) stateless monitoring solution
intended for implementing ad-hoc monitoring for small teams across large domains
or organisations. It aims to solve the problem of monitoring governance and
allow teams to very easily, independently, and discretely monitor what is
meaningful to them.

Tocsin was born out of the desire to be able to easily spin up ad-hoc monitoring
of services for a degradation in services provided by external teams, or even to
monitor for requested changes in those services.
